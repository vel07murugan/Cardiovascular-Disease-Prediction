# Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be one of the most critical global health threats, contributing to millions of deaths annually. Early and accurate prediction of CVD risk plays a vital role in reducing mortality through timely clinical intervention. This research proposes a hybrid predictive framework that leverages both traditional machine learning and advanced deep learning models to enhance risk stratification using patient health profiles. The study utilizes a large-scale tabular dataset containing over 300,000 patient records, incorporating clinical features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking habits, and glucose levels. The machine learning component includes Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, known for their ability to handle complex feature interactions and deliver robust performance on tabular data. On the deep learning front, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and TabNet are implemented to model non-linear relationships and enhance feature interpretability through attention-based learning. The hybrid ensemble approach integrates predictions from all models to improve overall diagnostic accuracy, reduce false positives, and support informed clinical decision-making.
